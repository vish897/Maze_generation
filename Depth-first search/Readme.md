# Depth first search algorithm with recursive back tracking

Algortihm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm

This was implemented in MATLAB & p5.js.

The p5.js implementation was inspired from The coding train's video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4) but has a different way of implementing the algorithm. It also has an additional functionality to solve the maze using keyboard. 

W : Moves up

A : Moves left

S : Moves down

D : Moves right

P : Deletes the previous action

C : Clears the whole path
