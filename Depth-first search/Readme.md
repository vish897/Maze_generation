Algortihm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm

This was implemented in MATLAB & p5.js.

The p5.js was done with the help of The coding train's video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4) and has an additional functionality to solve the maze using keyboard. 

W : Moves up 
A : Moves left
